# lantics.me
this is the express server used for my website ([lantics.me](https://lantics.me/))

all changes to the webserver are directly pulled from the master branch of this repo.

all issues, PRs etc will be looked at, so if my code is horrible or whatnot, you can make one (if you feel inclined)
